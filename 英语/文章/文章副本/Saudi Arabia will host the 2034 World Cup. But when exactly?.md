ZURICH (AP) — Saudi Arabia ==scored== a major win in its campaign to attract major sports events to the kingdom when it was ====formally==== [appointed as the 2034 World Cup host](https://apnews.com/article/fifa-world-cup-2030-2034-saudi-arabia-spain-portugal-945f8d7bf332553de0726901d096b956) on Wednesday.

Still, many questions remain about the ====tournament==== as well as the 2030 World Cup, which will be co-hosted by Spain, Portugal and Morocco, with three games in South America.

Here are some of the key issues that need to be answered over the next decade:

# Where will games be played?

Saudi Arabia proposes 15 ======stadium==s==== — eight still on paper — in five cities: Eight in the capital Riyadh, four in the Red Sea port city Jeddah, and one each in Abha, Al Khobar and Neom, the planned ====futuristic==== mega-project. Each would have at least 40,000 seats for World Cup games.

The opening game and final are set for a 92,000-seat ==venue== planned in Riyadh. Some designs are [vivid](https://apnews.com/article/2034-world-cup-fifa-saudi-arabia-stadiums-f969935147aa76d74e215aebd06d3848). In Neom, the ====stadium==== is planned 350 meters (yards) above street level and [one near Riyadh](https://apnews.com/article/saudi-arabia-fifa-world-cup-stadium-qiddiya-6523d5286b89ab46929637ed98c5ff4a) is designed to be atop a 200-meter ==cliff== with a ====retractable==== wall of LED screens.

Saudi Arabia aims to host all 104 games, though there has been ====speculation==== that some games could be played in neighboring or nearby countries.

# When will the World Cup be played?

Surely not in the traditional World Cup period of June-July, when temperatures in Saudi Arabia ====routinely==== exceed 40 Celsius (104 degrees).

FIFA moved the Qatar-hosted World Cup to November-December 2022, though those dates were not loved by most European clubs and leagues whose seasons were interrupted. Also, that slot is complicated in 2034 by the ==holy== month of Ramadan through mid-December and Riyadh hosting the multi-sport Asian Games.

January 2034 could be a possibility even though that would be just before the Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City. The [International Olympic Committee has signaled](https://apnews.com/article/saudi-arabia-ioc-fifa-2034-world-cup-winter-olympcis-a8eecde9a6e438ef2133bbb253f271a1) it won’t be opposed to ====back-to-back==== major events.

In an interview with The Associated Press on Wednesday, Saudi World Cup ==bid== official Hammad Albalawi said the precise dates of the ====tournament==== are up the world soccer body.

“That’s a decision by FIFA. We stand ready to be part of this conversation. But ultimately it’s a FIFA decision together with the ====confederations==,==” Albalawi said.

# Will ======stadium==s==== be segregated for men and women?

Giving more rights and freedoms to women in a traditionally ====conservative==== ====society==== is fundamental to Saudi messaging around the modernization program known as Vision 2030.

The kingdom [decided in 2017](https://apnews.com/general-news-606ea3c22c8b4ab6a4d82d3dc031c78f) to let women attend sports events, initially in major cities and [in family zones](https://apnews.com/article/54adcc61344744f492c0710f75524523) separate from men-only sections.

By 2034, at the promised pace of social reforms, female fans should not be restricted.

Saudi Arabia launched a women’s professional soccer league in 2022 with players joining from clubs in Europe. They face no restrictions playing in shorts and with hair uncovered.

# Will alcohol be allowed at the venues or hotels?

The Saudi prohibition of alcohol is clear and understood before FIFA signs any sponsor deals for 2034. But will there be any exceptions?

The alcohol issue was problematic for the World Cup in Qatar because the expectation was created that beer sales would be allowed at ======stadium==s==== even before Qatar won its ==bid== in 2010. One year later, FIFA extended a long-time deal to have Budweiser as the official World Cup beer through 2022.

Qatar then ====backtracked==== on that promise three days before the first game, causing confusion and the sense of a promise broken.

In Qatar, alcohol was served only at ==luxury== ==suites== at the ======stadium==s==.== Visitors could also have a drink in some hotel bars.

But Saudi Arabia has even stricter rules on alcohol — and there is no indication that will change.

Albalawi noted that Saudi Arabia has successfully hosted dozens of sports events where alcohol wasn’t served.

“We’re creating a safe and secure family environment for fans to bring their families into our ======stadium==s==,==” he said.

# How will workers rights be protected?

Saudi promises to reform and enforce labor laws, and fully respect migrant workers, have been accepted by FIFA but face [broad skepticism from rights groups](https://apnews.com/article/2034-world-cup-saudi-arabia-migrant-labor-human-rights-fcf03a475a23fda09583ef69176337a0) and trade unions. A [formal complaint is being investigated](https://apnews.com/article/ilo-labor-complaint-saudi-arabia-fifa-8767e862bffba8e49e021e515d5b306b) by the U.N.-backed International Labor Organization.

Protecting the migrant workers needed to build ======stadium==s==== and other ====tournament==== projects — a decade after it was a defining issue for Qatar — ==looms== as a signature challenge for Saudi Arabia.

# Would Israel be allowed to play if it qualified for the 2034 World Cup?

[Saudi-Israeli relations](https://apnews.com/article/davos-israel-herzog-openai-altman-773e21a96baff820d27e7f2c0211f34a) had been improving when FIFA all but gave the 2034 World Cup to the kingdom on Oct. 4 last year. Three days later Hamas attacked Israel and ====diplomacy==== got more complicated.

Any soccer federation bidding to host a FIFA ====tournament==== accepts a basic principle that whichever team qualifies is welcome.

That did not stop ====Indonesia==== putting up barriers last year to Israel coming for the men’s Under-20 World Cup. ====Indonesia==== does not have formal diplomatic relations with Israel which had qualified through a European ====tournament==== nine months before [the issue flared.](https://apnews.com/article/indonesia-isreal-u20-world-cup-fifa-165dacc34b2803682de9ce4d6216585b)

FIFA moved the entire ====tournament==== to Argentina and the Israeli team reached the ====semifinals==.==

Israel played at the 1970 World Cup but has never advanced through qualifying in Europe, where it has been a member of UEFA for 30 years. Europe should have 16 places in the 48-team World Cup in Saudi Arabia.

# Where will the final of the 2030 World Cup be played?

Most of the attention at the FIFA ====Congress==== on Wednesday was on the Saudi decision, but the soccer body and its members also ====formally==== approved the hosts of the 2030 World Cup — the most spread out and longest ever.

One game each in Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay, the original host in 1930, will be played from June 8-9. The ====tournament==== resumes four days later for the other 101 games shared between Spain, Portugal and Morocco.

Six countries, three continents, multiple languages and currencies. Fans traveling on planes, trains, automobiles and boats across about 14 kilometers (10 miles) of water between Spain and Morocco.

The final is due on July 21, 2030 and a decision on where it will be played could cause some tension between the host countries.

Morocco wants it in the world’s biggest soccer ==venue== — the planned 115,000-seat King Hassan II ====Stadium==== in Casablanca. Spain, meanwhile, has proposed to host the final in either of the remodeled home ======stadium==s==== of club giants Real Madrid or Barcelona.
