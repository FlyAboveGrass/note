Career-networking site LinkedIn has told Australian lawmakers it is too ==dull== for kids to ====warrant==== its inclusion in a proposed ban on social media for under 16 year olds.

"LinkedIn simply does not have content interesting and appealing to ==minors,==" the Microsoft-owned company said in a ====submission==== to an Australian ==senate== committee.

The Australian government has said it [will introduce "world-leading" ====legislation====](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c4gzd62g1r3o) to stop children accessing social media platforms.

But companies behind some of the most popular platforms with young people - Meta, Google, Snapchat-owner Snap Inc and TikTok - have all challenged the planned law in ==submission==s made to lawmakers.

Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has said the proposed law is to address the harm social media was ====inflicting==== on Australian children.

He said it was for "the mums and dads" who like him were "worried sick about the safety of our kids online."

Other countries are closely watching what happens with the ====legislation==== with some - [including the UK](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/ce9gpdrx829o) - saying they are open to following suit.

Australia's ==Senate== Environment and Communications ====Legislation==== Committee gave ====respondents==== one day to comment on the bill, which would ==amend== its existing Online Safety Act.

Its [report to the ==Senate==](https://parlinfo.aph.gov.au/parlInfo/download/committees/reportsen/RB000547/toc_pdf/OnlineSafetyAmendment(SocialMediaMinimumAge)Bill2024[Provisions].pdf) concludes the bill should pass - providing its recommendations, such as ====engaging==== young people in the ====legislation=='==s implementation, are considered.

## 'Significant concerns'

However, in their responses, the world's biggest tech firms have been setting out why they are unhappy with the proposed law.

Google - which owns YouTube - and Instagram-parent Meta have said they needed more time to consider the ====legislation==.==

Meta said its current ==form== "will fail to achieve its goal of reducing the ==burden== on parents to manage the safety of young people on social media".

It also claimed it "ignores the evidence" presented by child safety and ==mental== health experts - a view shared by Snapchat in its own ====submission==.==

X (formerly Twitter), meanwhile questioned the legality of the bill's proposals.

TikTok Australia said it had "significant concerns" with the bill as proposed.

Like other platforms commenting on the ====legislation==,== it said it =="hinges"== on an ongoing age ====assurance==== trial looking at technologies that can effectively check user age.

Ella Woods-Joyce, director of public policy for TikTok Australia and New Zealand, wrote in the company's ====submission==== that the bill's "rushed passage poses a serious risk of further ====unintended==== consequences".

But LinkedIn has adopted a different approach - arguing in its ====submission==== that is a platform which is simply not of any interest to children.

Its minimum age requirement of 16 means they cannot access it, the company said, adding it removes child accounts when found.

If LinkedIn can successfully argue it should not be included in the ====legislation==== it will potentially avoid the cost and disruption involved it introducing additional age verification processes to the site.

"Subjecting LinkedIn’s platform to regulation under the proposed ====legislation==== would create unnecessary barriers and costs for LinkedIn’s members in Australia to undertake age ====assurance==,==" it said.

## Interest elsewhere

The Australian government has said it wants to bring in the ====legislation==== before the end of the ====parliamentary==== year.

But experts have said the bill's ====timeframe==== and current ====composition==== fails to provide an opportunity for ====adequate==== ====scrutiny==.==

Carly Kind, the country's privacy ====commissioner==,== said [in a LinkedIn post](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/laws-bans-can-make-kids-safer-online-carly-kind-1owee/?trackingId=lmZPFXaZQXWeAMLZ6nxAYg%3D%3D) on Monday after appearing at a public ==Senate== hearing that she was concerned by "the widespread privacy implications of a social media ban".

Human rights ====commissioner==== Lorraine Findlay called the one-day window for ==submission==s of responses to the ====legislation==== "entirely in====adequate=="== [in a LinkedIn post on Thursday](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/lorrainejfinlay_a-social-media-ban-has-serious-implications-activity-7265210161324003328-m6Gg).

"We need actual ====consultation==,== not just the appearance of it," she said.

Nonetheless, the Australian government's plans have sparked interest elsewhere.

In the UK, the technology ====secretary==,== Peter Kyle, told the BBC this month that similar ====legislation==== was "on the table."

France has already introduced ====legislation==== requiring social media platforms to block access to children under 15 without parental ==consent==- though research indicates almost half of users were able to ====circumvent==== the ban using a simple VPN.
