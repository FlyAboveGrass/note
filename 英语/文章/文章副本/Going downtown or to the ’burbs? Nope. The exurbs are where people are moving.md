HAINES CITY, Fla. (AP) — Not long ago, Polk County’s biggest draw was ==citrus== instead of people. Located between Tampa and Orlando, Florida’s ==citrus== capital produces more boxes of ==citrus== than any other ==county== in the state and has devoted tens of thousands of ==acres== to growing millions of trees.

But last year, [more people moved to the ==county==](https://apnews.com/article/florida-population-growth-census-immigration-22a1d46ad275f27b4cbf45611aea2760) than to any other in the United States, almost 30,000.

==Bulldozed== ==citrus== groves in recent years made way for housing and big box stores that could one day merge the two ====metropolitan==== areas into what has half-jokingly been ==dubbed,== “Orlampa.”

The migration — and property ==sprawl== — reflects a significant kind of growth seen all over the country this decade: the rise of the ====far-flung==== ==exurbs.==

====Outlying==== communities on the outer margins of metro areas — some as far away as 60 miles (97 kilometers) from a city’s center — had some of the fastest-growing populations last year, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. Those communities are primarily in the South, like Anna on the ====outskirts==== of the Dallas-Fort Worth metro area; Fort Mill, South Carolina, outside Charlotte, North Carolina; Lebanon outside Nashville; and Polk County’s Haines City.

For some residents, like Marisol Ortega, ====commuting==== to work can take up to an hour and a half one-way. But Ortega, who lives in Haines City about 40 miles (64 kilometers) from her job in Orlando, says it’s worth it.

“I love my job. I love what I do, but then I love coming back home, and it’s more ====tranquil====”, Ortega said.

## A ====pandemic==== ==exodus== and more

The rapid growth of ====far-flung==== ==exurbs== is an after-effect of the COVID-19 ====pandemic==,== according to the Census Bureau, as rising housing costs drove people further from cities and remote working allowed many to do their jobs from home at least part of the week.

Polk County’s Hispanic population has grown from one-fifth to more than one-quarter of the overall population over the past five years, driven by Puerto Rican migration from the island after 2017’s Hurricane Maria and then from New York during the ====pandemic==.==

The ==county== has grown more ====diverse==== with the share of non-Hispanic white residents dropping from 61% to 54%, and it has also gotten more educated and wealthier, according to the Census Bureau. Despite the ==influx== of new people, the county’s Republican ====leanings==== have remained relatively unchanged.

Yeseria Suero and her family moved from New York to Polk ==County== at the start of the decade after falling in love with the pace of life and affordability during a visit. Still, there were some cultural adjustments: restaurants closing early, barbecue and ==boiled== peanuts everywhere, strangers chatting with her at the grocery store. Suero is now involved with the ====tight-knit==== Hispanic community and her two boys are active in sports ====leagues==.==

“My kids now say, ‘Yes, ma’am,’” she said.

Recent ====hurricanes==== and ==citrus== diseases in Florida also have made it more attractive for some Polk ==County== growers to sell their ==citrus== groves to developers who build new residences or stores.

Over the past decade, citrus-growing there declined from [81,800 ==acres== (33,103 hectares) and almost 10 million trees](https://www.nass.usda.gov/Statistics_by_State/Florida/Publications/Citrus/Citrus_Statistics/2013-14/fcs1314.pdf) in 2014 to [58,500 ==acres== (23,674 hectares) and 8.5 million trees](https://www.nass.usda.gov/Statistics_by_State/Florida/Publications/Citrus/Commercial_Citrus_Inventory/Commercial_Citrus_Inventory_Prelim/ccipr24.pdf) in 2024, according to federal agricultural statistics.

“It hasn’t been a ====precipitous==== ====conversion==== of ==citrus== land for growth,” said Matt Joyner, CEO of Florida ==Citrus== Mutual, a grower’s group. “But certainly you see it in northern, northeastern Polk.”

## An exurb of an exurb

Anna, Texas, more than 45 miles (72 kilometers) north of ====downtown==== Dallas, is seeing the same kind of migration.

It was the fourth-fastest growing city in the U.S. last year and its population has increased by a third during the 2020s to 27,500 residents. Like Polk ==County,== Anna has gotten a little older, richer and more racially ====diverse==.== Close to 3 in 5 ====households==== have moved into their homes since 2020, according to the Census Bureau.

Schuyler Crouch, 29, and his wife wanted to buy a house in a ====closer-in==== exurb like Frisco, where he grew up, so they could settle down and start a family. But prices there have ====skyrocketed==== [because of population growth](https://apnews.com/article/dallas-cowboys-sports-india-texas-c66b2f9869917585b5e47e404ac312c1).

In Anna, they fell in love last year with a house that was more reasonably priced. They both work in Frisco, about 30 miles (48 kilometers) away, and it has become their go-to for eating out or entertainment instead of ====downtown==== Dallas, even though not long ago Frisco itself was considered a ====far-flung==== ====outpost==== of the metro area.

Still, Crouch said he has noticed the ==exurbs== keep getting pushed further north as ====breakneck==== growth makes affordable housing out of reach in neighborhoods once considered on the ====fringes==== of the metro area.

“The next exurb we are going to be living in is Oklahoma,” he joked.
