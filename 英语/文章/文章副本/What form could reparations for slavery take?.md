Calls for the UK to provide reparations for its historical role in the slave trade have ====reignited==== ahead of a meeting of Commonwealth countries on Friday.

While Sir Keir Starmer said ====reparatory==== justice would not be on the ==agenda,== Commonwealth leaders have ==defied== the prime minister [and plan to move towards a "meaningful conversation" on the issue.](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cd6vy79p750o)

The UK has long faced calls to provide reparations for its role in the Atlantic slave trade which saw millions of Africans enslaved and forced to work, largely on ====plantations==== in the Caribbean and Americas.

The chancellor told the BBC the UK [would not be "paying out" reparations](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cn01ljdl07xo) - but might there be other forms of reparations to consider, and how likely is it that the UK would ==commit== to them?


Reparations are measures to make ==amends== for past actions ==deemed== wrong or unfair.

From 1500, the British government and the ====monarchy==== were ====prominent==== participants in the centuries-long slave trade, ====alongside==== other European nations.

Britain also had a key role in ending the trade, through Parliament's passage of a law to ====abolish==== slavery in 1833.

As part of that law, British plantation owners were paid for the loss of their slaves, to the ==tune== of some £20m.

The UK only finished paying off the debt it ====incurred==== to cover the payments in 2015.

Reparations for the benefit of those who suffered as result of slavery can take many forms, from financial to ====symbolic==.==

The United Nations says they must be “==proportional== to the ====gravity==== of the violations and the harm suffered”.

Here are some of the forms they can take.

## Money

This is the most commonly understood form of ====reparatory==== justice – where a state gives money to a country whose communities it enslaved.

A 2023 report co-authored by a United Nations’ judge concluded that the UK [owed more than £18tn to 14 countries in reparations.](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-66596790)

The difficulty is that most European countries would struggle to find ==sums== as ====astronomic==== as that.

The UK government, for example, spends a total of about [£1.2tn every year.](https://researchbriefings.files.parliament.uk/documents/CBP-8046/CBP-8046.pdf)

Even if governments could find the money, it would be politically unpopular to spend so much on reparations and ====consequently==== less on schools and hospitals at home.

Some campaigners answer these points by saying reparations could be paid over time.

But many ====demands==== for straight cash payments are considered ====unfeasible==== by Western governments.

So for others, the ==debate== about financial reparations often focuses instead on the question of debt relief.

Many developing countries which suffered from slavery owe large ==sums== to Western countries.

The cancellation or reduction of that debt could lift a massive economic ==burden== from a developing country at little political cost for a donor country.

## Apology

On the face of it, this could appear relatively straightforward.

It does not cost anything, just a public act of ====atonement==== for past ==sins.==

Some ====institutions==== – such as the Church of England – have apologised for links to slavery.

The difficulty, though, is that apologies can sometimes act as a declaration of legal responsibility for which there could be a financial cost.

Which is why states are often ====reluctant==== to take that step.

Earlier this week, former Prime Minister Tony Blair suggested it was wrong for states to apologise for historic wrongs – despite himself [saying “sorry” in 2007.](https://www.reuters.com/article/world/blair-says-sorry-for-slavery-idUSMOL060036/)

"You can go back over history, and you end up in a completely ==absurd== position", he told [Newsweek](https://www.newsweek.com/tony-blair-middle-east-israel-iran-leadership-1972118) on Wednesday.

"The most important thing we can do for countries that have been marked by ====colonialism==== is to help them now.”

Few states that played a historic role in the slave trade have taken steps towards reparations.


## Education

This includes educational ====institutions==== acknowledging their own connection to slavery and how they might have profited from the slave trade.

It can also involve teaching the history of slavery, as well as creating ====institutions==== for the study of slavery.

There are also calls for supporting schools to ==tackle== low ====literacy==== levels and other issues that some argue date back to the slave trade.

Some campaigners say school exchanges and cultural tours would also be beneficial.

The countries pushing hardest for ====reparatory==== justice from the UK are in the Caribbean - and their collective organisation, known as Caricom, [has its own reparations commission with 10 ====demands==.==](https://caricomreparations.org/caricom/caricoms-10-point-reparation-plan/)

Three of these deal ====explicitly==== with education and culture, saying a "restoration of historical memory" was required.

Caricom said states involved in the slave trade had a responsibility to "build educational capacity and provide ====scholarships=="==.

## Health

Some argue that ====reparatory==== justice should also include health - where European countries fund ====clinics==== and hospitals.

Medical evidence shows a high rate of type 2 ====diabetes==== in the Caribbean which some suggest is associated with centuries of poor ====nutrition==== due to past enslavement.

Historian Sir Hilary Beckles told the United Nations's [UN News](https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/04/1148166) earlier this year: "If you look at countries with the greatest ====incidence==== of ====chronic==== diseases, black people have the highest ====proportions==== of ====diabetic==== adult patients in the world."

He argued high rates of ====diabetes==== on his own island of Barbados "cannot be a co====incidence=="== given it was "the first island to have an African majority and an enslaved population".

Barbados' government has [moved toward](https://barbadostoday.bb/2024/10/24/health-climate-come-to-fore-in-reparations-dialogue/) exploring the historic impact of slavery on its population's health.

Caricom is calling for European countries to invest in science, technology and ====capital==== toward improving hospitals, healthcare, and ==mental== health support for the ======descendant==s==== of enslaved people.

## Is the UK likely to provide reparations?

The UK government has never ====formally==== apologised for slavery or offered to pay reparations – and Sir Keir Starmer has not shown any ====intention==== to break the ==mould.==

It is not Labour Party policy to introduce reparations.

Ahead of the Commonwealth ==summit,== the prime minister ====explicitly==== said he would not provide an apology or financial ====compensation==== for slavery.

He said he wanted to focus on present issues, like the climate, rather than the past.

Chancellor Rachel Reeves doubled down on Thursday afternoon, insisting the UK would not be paying reparations.

"I'd rather roll up my sleeves and work... on the current ====future-facing==== challenges than spend a lot of time on the past", she said.

In 2023, then Prime Minister Rishi Sunak ====likewise==== refused to provide ====compensation==== or an apology for the slave trade.

“Trying to unpick our history is not the right way forward”, he said.
