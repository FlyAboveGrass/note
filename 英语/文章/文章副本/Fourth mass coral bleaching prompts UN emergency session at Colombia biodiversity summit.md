CALI, Colombia (AP) — The United Nations, scientists and governments made an urgent call Wednesday for increased funding to protect ==coral== ==reefs== under threat of extinction.

Research this year shows that 77% of the world’s ==reefs== are affected by ====bleaching==,== mainly due to [warming ocean waters amid human-caused climate change](https://apnews.com/article/coral-texas-flower-garden-banks-bleaching-climate-change-4f779ea8889becd67e0810b395e02eb4). It’s the largest and fourth mass global ====bleaching==== on record and is impacting both ====hemispheres==,== United Nations Capital Development Fund said.

The findings prompted a U.N. special emergency ====session==== — typically called to address ====escalating==== conflicts or natural disasters — on corals to be ====convened==== on sidelines of the U.N. biodiversity summit, known as COP16, nearing its end after two weeks in Cali, Colombia.

==Coral== ==reefs== are ==vital== ecosystems that support over 25% of ==marine== life and nearly a billion people, many relying on ==reefs== for food security, ====coastal==== protection and livelihoods, the U.N. development fund said.

After the emergency ====session==,== the governments of New Zealand, the United Kingdom, Germany and France made new pledges totaling around $30 million to the U.N. fund for ==coral== ==reefs== ====established==== in 2020. By 2030, the fund seeks to ====leverage==== up to $3 billion in public and private finance to support ==coral== reef ====conservation==== efforts. Around $225 million has been raised to date.

“Protecting our ocean and its ====precious==== habitats is fundamental to life on earth,” said U.K. Minister for Nature Mary Creagh. “But without urgent action, the world’s ==coral== ==reefs== face extinction from global heating, ====acidification==,== disease, and pollution; a ==vital== ecosystem lost within our lifetime.”

Next year, a U.N. ocean ====conference==== will take place in Nice, France, and countries are being urged beforehand to pledge more to the U.N. global fund for ==coral== ==reefs== with the aim of ====mobilizing==== an additional $150 million in donations by the ====conference==.==

“In 2024, climate change and other human impacts triggered the fourth mass ==coral== reef ====bleaching==== event, the most ====extensive==== and ====devastating==== on record,” said Peter Thomson, the U.N. Secretary-General’s Special Envoy for the Ocean. “With the window to protect these ecosystems closing rapidly, world leaders must act now.”

“We must secure a ==sustainable== future for ==coral== ==reefs== and the countless lives that rely on them —before it’s too late,” Thomson said.

A change in [water temperature can cause ==coral== to drive out ==algae==](https://oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/coral_bleach.html) that provides ====nutrition==,== lose its color and become stressed. ==Coral== may bleach for other reasons, such as extremely low ==tides,== pollution or too much sunlight.

In the world’s largest ==coral== reef ecosystem, [Australia’s Great Barrier Reef](https://apnews.com/article/climate-science-australia-united-nations-corals-0bbcbcf4eaed841a5a72b4d4f3d40587), ====bleaching==== affected 90% of the ==coral== assessed in 2022. The [Florida ==Coral== Reef](https://apnews.com/article/florida-keys-coral-bleaching-caribbean-45e03ca1a6521e46720119b799e96116), the third-largest, experienced significant ====bleaching==== last year.

The first mass ====bleaching==== happened in 1998, the second between 2011-2013, the third in 2016, said Kenyan ==marine== ecologist David Obura, who heads ====Coastal==== Oceans Research and Development in the Indian Ocean East Africa.

“They’re lasting more than one year at a time, which is worrying,” Obura said at the U.N. emergency ====session==== at COP16.
