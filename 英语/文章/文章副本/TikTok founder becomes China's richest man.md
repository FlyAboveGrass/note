The ====surging==== global popularity of TikTok has seen the ====co-founder==== of its parent company, ByteDance, become China's richest person.

According to a rich list [produced by the Hurun Research Institute](https://www.hurun.net/en-US/Info/Detail?num=8S9MBRWXLAT6), Zhang Yiming is now worth $49.3bn (£38bn) - 43% more than in 2023.

The 41-year-old [====stepped down==== from his role in charge of the company in 2021](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-57181225), but is understood to own around 20% of the firm.

TikTok has become one of the most popular social media apps in the world, despite deep concerns in some countries about its ties to the Chinese state.

While both companies ==insist== they are independent of the Chinese government, [the US intends to ban TikTok](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-53476117) in January 2025 unless ByteDance sells it.

Despite facing that ====intense==== pressure in the US, [ByteDance's global profit increased by 60% last year](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-04-10/bytedance-profit-jumps-60-taking-it-past-archrival-tencent), ====driving up==== Zhang Yiming's personal fortune.

“Zhang Yiming is the 18th new Number One we have had in China in just 26 years," said head of Hurun Rupert Hoogewerf.

"The US, by comparison, has only four Number Ones: Bill Gates, Warren Buffett, Jeff Bezos and Elon Musk.

"This gives an ====indication==== of some of the ====dynamism==== in the Chinese economy."

## ==Tech== fortunes

Mr Zhang is not the only representative of China's huge ==tech== sector on the list.

Pony Ma, boss of the ==tech== ====conglomerate==,== Tencent, is third on the list with an estimated personal wealth amounting to £44.4bn.

But their fortunes are not just explained by their companies successes - their ==rivals== have made less in a year in which [China's economy has ====sputtered====](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cl4y6mexgz8o).

In fact, only approximately 30% of the people on the list had an increase in their net worth - the rest saw a ====decline==.==

“The Hurun China Rich List has ==shrunk== for an ====unprecedented==== third year running, as China’s economy and stock markets had a difficult year," said Mr Hoogewerf.

"The number of individuals on the list was down by 12% in the past year to just under 1100 individuals and 25% from the high point of 2021."

He said the data showed it had been a good year for smartphone ====manufacturers==== such as Xiaomi, while the green energy market had ====stumbled==.==

“Solar panel, lithium battery and EV makers have had a challenging year, as competition ====intensified==,== leading to a ==glut,== and the threat of ====tariffs==== added to uncertainties," he said.

"Solar panel makers saw their wealth down as much as 80% from the 2021 peak, ==whilst== battery and EV makers were down by half and a quarter ====respectively==.=="
