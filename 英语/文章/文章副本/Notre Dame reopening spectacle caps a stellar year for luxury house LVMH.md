PARIS (AP) — The [reopening of ====Notre Dame==== was a solemn celebration of cultural and spiritual renewal](https://apnews.com/article/france-notre-dame-reopening-paris-macron-f2543dc70b4d89b256cde9aa53bbbd44). Yet for some, the historic ==cathedral==’s ====revival==== also felt like a ====meticulously==== ====choreographed==== branding event by LVMH and other luxury ====conglomerates==.==

[Bernard Arnault, the lowkey billionaire behind luxury powerhouse LVMH](https://apnews.com/article/olympics-2024-bernard-arnault-lvmh-ceo-0ab4a42d0bb6be6cb3989412ca19d318) and a key ====Notre Dame==== donor who regularly tops the list of the world’s richest men, was at the center of the celebration. He was surrounded by his family, the French president, the ====archbishop==== and ====clergy,==== and the unmistakable symbols of his luxury empire’s influence, including its brands Louis Vuitton and Dior.

France’s first lady Brigitte Macron and her U.S. ====counterpart==,== Jill Biden, both had Lady Dior handbags. Louis Vuitton artistic director Pharrell Williams performed kitted out in Louis Vuitton. South African ====soprano==== Pretty Yende also contributed with a ====rendition==== of “Amazing Grace” while wearing a Dior gown ====adorned==== with 110 ==carats== of diamonds.

Welcome to the “==inauguration== of the LVMH ==arena,==” commented television journalist Yann Barthès about the ====cathedral==== ceremony.

LVMH has enjoyed unprecedented visibility in France in 2024, especially as a high-profile sponsor of the Paris 2024 Olympics.

Some questioned the taste of such brand ====prominence==== occurring in a ==sacred== space like the beloved ==Gothic== ====monument==,== while noting LVMH’s crucial contribution to the reconstruction.

“You can’t blame monsieur Arnault, a businessman, to do business. But people are now asking if it was an appropriate ==venue== for a display like that,” said fashion PR ====consultant==== Theo Fontaine.

“It’s been a great PR year for LVMH — that’s for sure,” Fontaine added. “The Olympics and now ====Notre Dame==.== The whole world has been watching.”

Not far behind Arnault sat representatives of Kering, adding another layer to the ongoing ====rivalry==== between France’s two largest luxury ====conglomerates==.==

Kering CEO François-Henri Pinault attended alongside his wife, ====actress==== Salma Hayek, who wore a ====tailored==== Gucci coat. Gucci is Kering-owned.

The event, marking the ====culmination==== of an 840 million ==euro== ($882 million) ====restoration==== effort following a ====devastating==== 2019 fire, brought together global ====dignitaries==== and cultural icons.

The ====restoration==== united France’s corporate giants. Arnault’s 200 million ==euro== donation was the largest, followed by 100 million ==euro== contributions from Pinault and the Bettencourt-Meyers family of L’Oréal. Over 250 companies and 2,000 craftspeople contributed to the five-year ====restoration==== effort, which reconstructed the ==spire,== repaired vaulted ceilings and restored stained-glass windows.

As the bells of ====Notre Dame==== rang out across Paris, the ==cathedral==’s rebirth stood as a ====testament==== to collective effort — but also for some as a symbol of how France’s seats of power and its prized luxury industry are ====inextricably==== ====intertwined==.==

French President Emmanuel Macron and Brigitte Macron welcomed heads of state, including President-elect Donald Trump, Britain’s Prince William and Elon Musk, to a ceremony ====steeped==== in tradition — and high fashion.

Arnault attended with his family, including Dior chair and CEO Delphine Arnault, LVMH image and environment director Antoine Arnault, Moët Hennessy ==deputy== CEO Alexandre Arnault, LVMH Watches CEO Frédéric Arnault, and Louis Vuitton product and development director for watches Jean Arnault. Antoine Arnault’s wife, model Natalia Vodianova, was also in attendance.

“I am proud of the outpouring of ====generosity==== from all over the world, to which the LVMH Group and my family wanted to contribute from the very beginning, which has enabled the ====restoration==== of this jewel of our heritage,” Antoine Arnault said in a statement posted to LinkedIn.

“This extraordinary project highlighted the excellence of French know-how and the talent of nearly 2,000 architects, workers and ====craftsmen==== of all trades,” he added.

Yet, public reaction was mixed

Papuna Biliseishvili, 24, who watched the ceremony in Paris, ====quipped==,== “If the devil wears Prada, the ====cathedral==== wears Louis Vuitton and Dior.”

Cari Lefebvre, 27, said “this is the most PR the Catholic Church has seen in centuries.”

Marie-Claire Dubois, a 45-year-old Catholic ====worshiper==== from Paris, expressed her disapproval. “This is a ==sacred== place. It is beautiful that these companies contributed, but the branding should have remained outside,” she said “==Notre Dame== deserves respect as a house of God, not a showcase for luxury.”

While the ====grandeur==== of the reopening sparked debate, Arnault’s donation and LVMH’s contributions to the ====cathedral==== ==restoration==—including 36 300-year-old oak trees for the spire—have been widely praised.

LVMH’s influence at the Paris 2024 Olympics further ====cemented==== its ====stellar==== year. The company ====crafted==== custom display cases for 5,000 medals and the Olympic ==torch,== showcasing its artistry and precision. Berluti, another LVMH brand, designed costumes for the opening ceremony, while an Olympic-themed Vogue World fashion show, supported by the group, drew international attention during Paris Couture Week.

Tensions between Arnault and Pinault, the driving forces behind LVMH and Kering respectively, were on full display with their brands’ ====prominent==== appearances at the ====cathedral==.== This ====rivalry==== dates back decades to a ==bitter== ====bidding==== war over Gucci in the late 1990s, which Pinault’s Kering ultimately won. Since then, their competition has extended beyond fashion into the ==realms== of art, ====philanthropy==== and global influence.

In ====Notre Dame==,== French luxury was also championed by the French Catholic church — and was on display even in the ==stitch== of the ====liturgical==== ====vestments==.== [French fashion designer Jean-Charles de Castelbajac was called on by the church to design the ==cathedral==’s 2,000 garments](https://apnews.com/article/notre-dame-designer-castelbajac-fashion-ab4fcfe8638c0250fab550e21970138f). The ====unorthodox==== designs were fun, modern — and perhaps shockingly ====minimalist==.== They ensured that even the clergy’s ==robes== reflected high-fashion artistry, further underscoring the intersection of faith and fashion at the event.
