The cost of UK government borrowing has risen to its highest level for more than a year in the ==wake== of Wednesday’s Budget.

The ====interest rate==== – the ====so-called==== ==yield== – the government has to pay ====lenders==== when it borrows money from them over a 10-year period, climbed above 4.5% on Thursday before falling back.

Yields have been driven higher after the chancellor announced a sharp rise in government borrowing to finance spending projects, ====sparking==== expectations that ==interest rate==s will fall more slowly.

This matters because not only does it mean the government will have to pay more to borrow, but ==bond== yields are also used as a guide for setting the rates on everyday loans and ====mortgages==.

The jump in how much the government has to pay to borrow is a signal that investors ==regard== lending it money as being a bigger risk.

The ==yield== on 10-year government ==bonds== hit 4.53% mid-Thursday afternoon before falling back to 4.46%.

But following the rise Chancellor Rachel Reeves told Bloomberg TV the government's "number one ====commitment=="was "economic and ==fiscal== stability".

“We have now put our public finances on a stable and a solid ====trajectory==,==” she said.

Earlier, Sir Keir Starmer's spokesperson said there had been reaction from "bodies such as the IMF welcoming [the government's] approach".

The BBC's economics editor Faisal Islam says ==so far== the rise in borrowing costs is a natural market adjustment rather than the ==panicked== reaction which followed Liz Truss's mini-Budget two years ago.

There has also been a wider rise in borrowing costs over the past month, but that has been a global movement led by the US, he adds.

In the Budget, Reeves announced nearly £70bn of extra spending a year, funded by tax increases for business and extra borrowing.

Analysts said the upwards movement in bond yields was an indication that the markets weren't happy about the increase in government spending.

Kathleen Brooks, an analyst at trading firm XTB, said the movement indicated that the Budget "has not been well received" by markets.

"This is another sign that the chancellor ====overestimated==== the market's desire to ==absorb== more ======sovereign====== ==debt== ====issuance==== from the UK," she said.

Susannah Streeter, head of money and markets at Hargreaves Lansdown, said expectations for ====interest rate==== cuts had been scaled back, given ====forecasts==== that the Budget could push up inflation over the next two years.

"Financial markets are now not expecting rates to fall below 4% until 2026," she said.

"This has been reflected in the ==spike== in UK ==gilt== yields to some extent, but given that ====sterling==== has remained lower against the dollar, it also indicates that there is a growing nervousness about the way Labour is ====steering==== the economy."
这在一定程度上反映在英国国债收益率的飙升中，但鉴于英镑兑美元汇率仍处于低位，这也表明人们对工党引导经济的方式越来越感到不安。


She said bond yields were set to stay "==volatile==" as institutions financing government borrowing "keep a more ====suspicious==== eye trained on what the ====swollen==== investment budget will be spent on".
