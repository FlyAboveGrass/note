WASHINGTON (AP) — This year’s presidential election could come down to ====microscopic==== margins, so [Kamala Harris](https://apnews.com/hub/kamala-harris) is hunting for votes in even the most ====unlikely==== of places. One of her latest targets is [Donald Trump](https://apnews.com/hub/donald-trump) ‘s ====demographic==== base — white people who didn’t attend college.

“It’s tough ==turf,==” said Dan Kanninen, the Harris ==campaign==’s ====battleground==== states director. “But showing up is how you peel away the votes that you need to win.”

Kanninen and other members of the ======Democrat==ic==== ==vice== president’s team point to what they believe are positive signals in public polls that Harris may be making small ====inroads==.== Such shifts are difficult to measure, particularly in polls where subgroups of voters can have wide margins of error.

But any ====erosion==== that does occur could be significant because white voters without a college degree make up a sizable share of the electorate. Around 4 in 10 voters fell into this category in 2020, according to AP VoteCast.

So the Harris ====campaign==== has been running advertisements on DraftKings, a sports betting website, that call Harris and her running mate, Minnesota Gov. [Tim Walz](https://apnews.com/hub/tim-walz), the “strongest line up.” Another version on Yahoo Sports features ==“stats,==” such as cutting taxes for the middle class and $25,000 in down payment assistance for first-time homebuyers.

An advertisement on the video game website IGN presents Harris like a character in a role playing ==saga.== Her rankings for “==charisma==” and “intelligence” are high, but “deception” and “==collateral== damager” are low. “Select this president,” it says.

More advertisements have run during football games, highlighting Harris’ promise to be a president for all Americans, and sports talk radio. Walz is a former high school football coach, so he’s been making the rounds at sporting events as well.

Off the airwaves, Harris is relying heavily on labor unions to ====make the case to==== their members and communities. And she talks frequently about economic concerns like price ====gouging==== that she hopes will ==appeal== to working class voters.

“People want somebody who is going to be on their side,” Kanninen said.

Whit Ayres, a Republican ====pollster==,== was doubtful that Harris was making any ====inroads==== with white working class voters. If anything, he said, her strategy was more a ====reflection==== of [her flush finances.](https://apnews.com/article/kamala-harris-third-quarter-fundraising-september-donald-trump-f8a21ae87b7a1c7127e8a3b6420dac7d)

“When you’re ==awash== in money as apparently the Harris ====campaign==== is, you go after anything that’s remotely possible,” he said.

Of course, Ayres said, “in a dead heat race, any voters you can squeeze from anywhere could be significant.”

Anna Kelly, a spokesperson for the Republican National Committee, dismissed Harris’ efforts.

“Kamala Harris is on ====defense==== because she is losing ground with long-time ====Democrat==== constituencies, like Black men,” Kelly said.

Kanninen said the Harris ====campaign==== was ====undeterred==.==

“There have been tough conversations sometimes,” he said. “But tough conversations can yield results, and in a very close race those results can be decisive.”
