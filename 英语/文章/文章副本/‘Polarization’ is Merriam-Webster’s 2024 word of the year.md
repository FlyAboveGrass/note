The results of the [2024 U.S. presidential election](https://apnews.com/hub/election-2024) ====rattled==== the country and sent shockwaves across the world — or were cause for celebration, depending on who you ask. Is it any surprise then that the [Merriam-Webster word of the year](https://www.merriam-webster.com/wordplay/word-of-the-year) is “==polarization==”?

“==Polarization== means division, but it’s a very specific kind of division,” said Peter Sokolowski, Merriam-Webster’s editor at large, in an exclusive interview with The Associated Press ahead of Monday’s announcement. “==Polarization== means that we are tending toward the extremes rather than toward the center.”

The election was so ====divisive==,== many American voters went to the polls with a feeling that the opposing candidate was an ====existential==== threat to the nation. [According to AP VoteCast,](https://apnews.com/projects/election-results-2024/votecast/) a survey of more than 120,000 voters, about 8 in 10 Kamala Harris voters were very or somewhat concerned that Donald Trump’s views — but not Harris’ — were too extreme, while about 7 in 10 Trump voters felt the same way about Harris — but not Trump.

The [Merriam-Webster entry for “==polarization==”](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/polarizing) reflects scientific and ====metaphorical==== definitions. It’s most commonly used to mean “causing strong disagreement between opposing ====factions==== or groupings.” Merriam-Webster, which logs 100 million pageviews a month on its site, chooses its word of the year based on data, tracking a rise in search and usage.

Last year’s [pick was “authentic.”](https://apnews.com/article/merriam-webster-word-of-year-2023-a9fea610cb32ed913bc15533acab71cc) This year’s comes as large ==swaths== of the U.S. struggle to reach ====consensus==== on what is real.

“It’s always been important to me that the dictionary serve as a kind of ====neutral==== and objective ====arbiter==== of meaning for everybody,” Sokolowski said. “It’s a kind of ====backstop==== for meaning in an ==era== of fake news, alternative facts, whatever you want to say about the value of a word’s meaning in the culture.”

It’s ====notable==== that “==polarization==” originated in the early 1800s — and not during the Renaissance, as did most words with Latin roots about science, Sokolowski said. He called it a “pretty young word,” in the scheme of the English language. “Polarized is a term that brings ====intensity==== to another word,” he continued, most frequently used in the U.S. to describe race relations, politics and ====ideology==.==

“The basic job of the dictionary is to tell the truth about words,” the Merriam-Webster editor continued. “We’ve had dictionaries of English for 420 years and it’s only been in the last 20 years or so that we’ve actually known which words people ====look up==.==”

“==Polarization==” extends beyond political ====connotations==.== It’s used to highlight fresh ==cracks== and deep ==rifts== alike [in pop culture,](https://apnews.com/article/pop-culture-2024-c985d4b171608dcc00bf07c3989512d3) tech trends and other industries.

All the ====scrutiny==== over [Taylor Swift’s private jet usage](https://apnews.com/article/taylor-swift-climate-jet-carbon-emissions-kelce-chiefs-02ac425d24281bd26d73bfdf4590bc82)? Polarizing. Beef between rappers [Kendrick Lamar and Drake](https://apnews.com/article/kendrick-lamar-new-album-gnx-243dcef7e1efd6d82903bd51d4ab242c)? Polarizing. The International Olympic Committee’s decision to ==strip== American [gymnast Jordan Chiles of her bronze medal](https://apnews.com/article/2024-olympics-gymnastics-jordan-chiles-d246c9d544faf9dfb44185ae3661e869) after the Paris Games? You guessed it: polarizing.

Even ====lighthearted==== memes — like those making fun of Australian breakdancer Rachael “Raygun” Gunn’s performance — or the ====proliferation==== of look-alike ====contests==,== or who counts as a ==nepo== baby proved polarizing.

# AP AUDIO: ‘==Polarization==’ is Merriam-Webster’s 2024 word of the year

Merriam Webster is out with their top word of the 2024. The AP’s Jennifer King reports.

====Paradoxically==== though, people tend to see eye to eye on the word itself. Sokolowski ==cited== its frequent use among people across the political ====spectrum==,== including commentators on Fox News, MSNBC and CNN.

“It’s used by both sides,” he said, “and in a little bit ==ironic== ==twist== to the word, it’s something that actually everyone agrees on.”

Rounding out Merriam-Webster’s top 10 words of 2024:

## ==Demure==

[TikToker Jools Lebron’s 38-second video](https://apnews.com/article/demure-tiktok-trend-content-creator-income-jools-lebron-ba2a60b3c5db4eaffef9f2e8d8a8eb34) describing her workday makeup routine as “very [==demure==](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/demure), very mindful” lit up the summer with memes. The video has been viewed [more than 50 million times](https://apnews.com/article/new-year-over-it-trends-2024-b715e7f95a2cddd398db14dbe7c66444), yielding “huge spikes” in lookups, Sokolowski said, and prompting many to learn it means ====reserved==== or ==modest.==

## ====Fortnight====

[Taylor Swift’s](https://apnews.com/hub/taylor-swift) song ==“==Fortnight==,==” featuring rapper Post Malone, undoubtedly ====spurred==== many searches for [this word](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/fortnight), which means two weeks. “Music can still send people to the dictionary,” Sokolowski said.

## ====Totality====

The [solar eclipse in April](https://apnews.com/hub/solar-eclipse-2024) inspired ==awe== and much travel. There are tens of millions of people who live along a narrow ====stretch==== from Mexico’s Pacific coast to eastern Canada, otherwise known as the path of [====totality====](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/totality), where locals and travelers ==gazed== ====skyward==== to see the moon fully ==blot== out the sun. Generally, the word refers to a sum or ====aggregate==== amount — or wholeness.

## ====Resonate====

“Texts developed by AI have a ====disproportionate==== percentage of use of the word [==‘==resonate==,==’”](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/resonate) Sokolowski said. This may be because the word, which means to affect or appeal to someone in a personal or emotional way, can add ====gravitas==== to writing. But, ====paradoxically==,== [artificial intelligence](https://apnews.com/hub/artificial-intelligence) “also betrays itself to be a robot because it’s using that word too much.”

## ====Allision====

The [word was looked up 60 times more](https://www.merriam-webster.com/wordplay/the-words-of-the-week-mar-29) often than usual when, in March, a ship crashed into the Francis Scott Key Bridge in Baltimore. “When you have one moving object into a fixed object, that’s an ====allision==,== not a ====collision==.== You’re showing that one of the two objects struck was not, in fact, in ==motion,==” Sokolowski said.

## ==Weird==

This summer on the TV news show “Morning Joe,” Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz called Republican leaders [==“weird.==”](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/weird) It may have been [what launched his national career,](https://apnews.com/article/kamala-walz-vp-weird-trump-gen-z-f9d718890c3ca907f42dba5934075382) landing him as the Democratic vice presidential ====nominee==.== Though it’s a word that people typically misspell — is it “ei” or “ie”? — and search for that reason, its rise in use was ====notable==,== Sokolowski said.

## ====Cognitive====

Whether [the word](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/cognitive) was used to raise questions about President Joe Biden’s ==debate== performance or Trump’s own age, it cropped up often. It refers to ====conscious==== intellectual activity — such as thinking, reasoning, or remembering.

## ==Pander==

[==Pander==](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/pander) was used widely in political commentary, Sokolowski said. “==Conservative== news outlets accused Kamala Harris of pandering to different groups, especially young voters, Black voters, gun rights supporters.” Whereas Walz said Trump’s visit to a McDonald’s kitchen pandered to hourly wage workers. It means to say, do, or provide what someone — such as an audience — wants or demands even though it is not “good, proper, reasonable, etc.”

## ====Democracy====

In 2003, Merriam-Webster decided to make “==democracy==” its first word of the year. Since then, the [word](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/democracy) — which, of course, means a form of government in which the people elect representatives to make decisions, policies and laws — is consistently one of the dictionary’s most looked up. “There’s a ====poignancy==== to that, that people are checking up on it,” Sokolowski said. “Maybe the most hopeful thing that the ====curiosity==== of the public shows, is that they’re paying attention.”
