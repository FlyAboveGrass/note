> [Chinese companies apologise for 'shrunken' sanitary pads](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cev9ry341dyo)

Major ====sanitary==== ==pad== makers in China are apologising after being accused of selling pads that are shorter than advertised.

It comes ==amid== a storm of anger after ==viral== social media videos showed Chinese women measuring the lengths of ====sanitary==== pads from popular brands - showing that most of them fell short of what was stated on their packaging.

The ==uproar== has extended into broader ====grievances==== about women being short-changed by ====feminine==== ====hygiene==== products, which have a history of safety ====scandals==== in China.

Chinese women have taken it upon themselves to call out quality concerns in ====sanitary==== pads, the most commonly used ====feminine==== ====hygiene==== product in the country.

In one of the earliest videos, posted on 3 November, a user on Chinese social media platform Xiaohongshu examined nine brands of ====sanitary==== pads with a measuring ==tape,== showing that they all fell short of the length stated on their packaging.

"Will cutting a few ====centimetres==== help you strike it rich?" the user wrote in her video.

The ====revelations==== soon ====ignited==== widespread criticism, with consumers accusing ====sanitary==== ==pad== makers of being ====deceitful==.==

"The inflated ====sanitary==== ==pad== length is just like the ====insoles==== under men’s feet," reads one popular Weibo post.

==Amid== the ==uproar,== an investigation of over 20 different ====sanitary==== pads by Chinese news outlet The Paper found that nearly 90% of the products were =="==shrunken=="==, measuring at least 10mm shorter than claimed on their packaging. Tucked within most of them were even shorter ====absorbent==== layers, which are meant to soak up menstrual flow.

The Paper also reported that while national standards for ====sanitary==== pads specify that the products can measure within 4% of advertised lengths, they do not specify the length of the ====absorbent==== layer in ====sanitary==== pads.

Following a ====torrent==== of complaints, authorities said they were ====revising==== the current national standard on ====sanitary==== pads, according to local media.

Met with ====enquiries==== and complaints from customers about the ====discrepancy==== in its ====sanitary==== ==pad== lengths, the popular Chinese brand ABC further stoked ====outrage==== after its customer service reportedly responded to a complaint by saying "if you cannot accept [the length difference] then you can choose not to buy it".

ABC said in a statement in mid-November that it was "deeply sorry" for the "inappropriate" response, and promised to improve its products to achieve "zero ====deviation=="==. Other companies including Shecare and Beishute have also issued apologies.

Chinese state media has also weighed in on the controversy, criticising manufacturers for cutting corners.

"As a daily necessity for women, quality of ====sanitary==== pads is directly related to the health and comfort of the user," reads a Xinhua article. "The problems existing in some products on the market cannot be ignored."

====Sanitary==== pads are the most commonly used ====feminine==== ====hygiene==== product in China, where the market is valued at $13bn (£10bn). However, the products have also made headlines over the years for safety issues.

In 2016, police ==busted== a massive "fake ====sanitary==== ==towel"== operation in southeast China, where millions of ====sanitary==== pads were manufactured in a factory without proper ====hygiene==== measures and packaged as popular brands. In 2021, popular ====feminine==== ====hygiene==== brand Space 7 apologised and ==vowed== an investigation after a woman claimed she found a needle in one of its ====sanitary==== pads.

The wave of anger also reflects broader ====grievances==== felt by women over the quality of products meant for them.

"Is it that hard for ====sanitary==== pads to tackle women’s needs?" reads a trending ====hashtag==== on Weibo.

Another trending phrase that has caught on ==amid== the blowback ====encapsulates==== the ==outrage==: "==Sanitary== pads yield a centimetre; women yield for a lifetime."
