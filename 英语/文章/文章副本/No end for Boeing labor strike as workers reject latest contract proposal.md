SEATTLE (AP) — Boeing factory workers voted against the company’s latest contract offer and remain on the ==picket== lines [six weeks into a ==strike==](https://apnews.com/article/boeing-strike-vote-machinists-12d008c0127bab57f8cc9941f48e3ac6) that has stopped production of the ====aerospace==== giant’s ====bestselling==== ==jetliner==s.

Local union leaders in Seattle said 64% of members of the International Association of Machinists and ====Aerospace==== Workers who ==cast== ====ballots==== Wednesday voted against accepting the [contract offer](https://apnews.com/article/boeing-strike-contract-offer-pay-increase-e86e43bcbbf3e140e89d33c901766554).

“After 10 years of ====sacrifices==,== we still have ground to make up, and we’re hopeful to do so by ====resuming==== ==negotiation==s promptly,” Jon Holden, the head of the IAM District 751 union, said in a statement Wednesday evening. “This is ====workplace==== ====democracy==== — and also clear evidence that there are ====consequences==== when a company mistreats its workers ====year after year==.==”

A spokesperson for Boeing said officials didn’t have a comment on the vote.

The labor ====standoff==== comes during an already challenging year for Boeing, which became the focus of multiple federal investigations after a door panel blew off a 737 Max plane during an Alaska Airlines flight in January.


The ==strike== has ====deprived==== the company of much-needed cash that it gets from delivering new planes to airlines. On Wednesday, the company reported a third-quarter loss of more than $6 billion.

Union machinists ====assemble==== [the 737 Max](https://apnews.com/article/boeing-plea-737-max-crashes-b34daa014406657e720bec4a990dccf6), Boeing’s best-selling airliner, along with the 777 or “triple-seven” jet and the 767 cargo plane at factories in Renton and Everett, Washington.

The latest rejected offer included pay raises of 35% over four years. The version that union members rejected when they voted to ==strike== last month featured a 25% increase over four years.

The union, which initially ====demanded==== 40% pay boosts over three years, said the annual raises in the ====revised==== offer would total 39.8%, when ====compounded==.==

Boeing has said that average annual pay for machinists is currently $75,608.

Boeing workers told Associated Press reporters that a sticking point was the company’s refusal to ====restore==== a [====traditional ====pension==== plan====](https://apnews.com/article/boeing-strike-machinists-contract-9f61a7d48675d1c3517233d40d4ec2b1) that was frozen a decade ago.

“The ====pension==== should have been the top priority. We all said that was our top priority, along with ==wage,==” Larry Best, a customer-quality ====coordinator==== with 38 years at Boeing, said on a ==picket== line outside a Boeing factory in Everett, Washington. “Now is the ==prime== opportunity in a ==prime== time to get our ====pension==== back, and we all need to stay out and dig our heels in.”

Theresa Pound, a 16-year Boeing ====veteran==,== also voted against the deal. She said the health plan has gotten more expensive and her expected ====pension==== benefits would not be enough, even when combined with a 401(k) retirement account.

“I have put more time in this place than I was ever required to. I have ====literally==== blood, sweat and tears from working at this company,” the 37-year-old said. “I’m looking at working until I’m 70 because I have this possibility that I might not get to retire based on what’s happening in the market.”

The ==strike== started Sept. 13 and has served as an early test for Boeing CEO Kelly Ortberg, who [became chief executive in August](https://apnews.com/article/boeing-ortberg-new-ceo-factory-visit-e5bada09a96d0e26b25f2d35d6d6cfc0).

In his first remarks to investors, Ortberg said earlier Wednesday that Boeing needs “a fundamental culture change,” and he laid out his plan to ==revive== the ====aerospace==== ==giant== after years of heavy losses and [damage to its ====reputation====](https://apnews.com/article/boeing-strike-manufacturing-reputation-3eed69b839021b24bfe792080c85b63c).

Ortberg repeated in a message to employees and on the earnings call that he wants to “reset” management’s relationship with labor “so we don’t become so disconnected in the future.” He said company leaders need to spend more time [on factory floors](https://apnews.com/article/boeing-ortberg-new-ceo-factory-visit-e5bada09a96d0e26b25f2d35d6d6cfc0) to know what is going on and “prevent the ====festering==== of issues and work better together to identify, fix, and understand root cause.”

Ortberg, a Boeing outsider who previously ran Rockwell Collins, a maker of avionics and flight controls for airline and ====military==== planes, said Boeing is at a crossroads.

“The trust in our company has ==eroded.== We’re ====saddled==== with too much debt. We’ve had serious ==lapses== in our performance across the company, which have disappointed many of our customers,” he said.

But Ortberg also highlighted the company’s ==strength==s, including a ====backlog==== of airplane orders valued at a half-==trillion== dollars.

“It will take time to return Boeing to its former ==legacy,== but with the right focus and culture, we can be an ==iconic== company and ====aerospace==== leader once again,” he said.

In recent weeks, Ortberg announced [large-scale layoffs](https://apnews.com/article/boeing-layoffs-strike-airplane-factories-de637999cf525699577b42b72bff2a70) — about 17,000 people — and a plan to [raise enough cash](https://apnews.com/article/boeing-new-stock-debt-finances-strike-b7839aef372f4b4e8312f9efbe8ef24b) to avoid a ====bankruptcy==== filing.

Boeing hasn’t had a profitable year since 2018, and Wednesday’s numbers represented the second-worst quarter in the ==manufacturer==’s history. Boeing lost $6.17 billion in the period ended Sept. 30, with an adjusted loss of $10.44 ====per share==.== Analysts polled by Zacks Investment Research had expected a loss of $10.34 ====per share==.==

====Revenue==== totaled $17.84 billion, matching Wall Street estimates.

The company burned nearly $2 billion in cash, in the quarter, weakening its ====balance sheet==,== which is loaded down with $58 billion in debt. Chief Financial Officer Brian West said the company will not generate positive cash flow until ====the second half of next year==.==

Boeing’s fortunes ==soured== after [two of its 737 Max ==jetliner==s](https://apnews.com/article/boeing-737-max-victims-plea-agreement-fraud-7b772b2ae171b0e3cb9916d10d05652f) crashed in October 2018 and March 2019, killing 346 people. Safety concerns were renewed this January, when a panel blew off a Max during an Alaska Airlines flight.

Ortberg needs to convince federal ====regulators==== that Boeing is fixing its [safety culture](https://apnews.com/article/boeing-senators-letter-justice-department-a9f4e3d5cd78cbbff899aab7c1a26759) and is ready to boost production of the 737 Max — a crucial step to bring in much-needed cash. That can’t happen, however, until the striking workers return to their jobs.

Early in the ==strike,== Boeing made what it ==termed== its [“best and final” offer](https://apnews.com/article/boeing-strike-labor-union-machinists-d40b23d9a0d0553a81ebc4de07c7d65d). The proposal included pay raises of 30% over four years, and angered union leaders because the company announced it to the striking workers through the media and set a short ====ratification==== deadline.

Boeing backed down and [gave the union](https://apnews.com/article/boeing-strike-offer-faa-safety-cb3de0dc02082efcb0d5f7d6287ea7a7) more time. However, many workers maintained the offer still wasn’t good enough. The company withdrew the proposed contract on Oct. 9 after ==negotiation==s broke down, and the two sides announced the latest proposal on Saturday.

Charles Fromong, a mechanic who has worked at Boeing for 38 years, said Wednesday night after the results were announced that the company needs to take care of its workers.

“I feel sorry for the young people,” he said. “I’ve spent my life here and I’m getting ready to go, but they deserve a ====pension==== and I deserve an increase.”

The last Boeing ==strike,== in 2008, lasted eight weeks and cost the company about $100 million daily in ====deferred==== ====revenue==.== A 1995 ==strike== lasted 10 weeks.
