DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip (AP) — A Palestinian ambulance worker made a ====horrific==== discovery when the bloody sheet was lifted: The ==corpse== on the ====stretcher==== was his own mother, killed by an Israeli airstrike Wednesday in central Gaza.

“Oh God, I swear — she’s my mother! I didn’t know it was her!” Abed Bardini ==sobbed== ==as== he leaned over his mother, Samira, ====cradling==== her head in his arms. Fellow Red Crescent medics tried to ====console==== him.

Bardini had ====unknowingly==== sat in the ambulance beside her body, wrapped in a white sheet ====stained==== dark with blood, ==as== the ====vehicle==== ====bounced==== across broken roads for about 2 kilometers (1.2 miles) toward Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in Deir al-Balah.

Three people were killed and at least 10 wounded by the Israeli strike on a car in Maghazi ====refugee==== camp, according to Palestinian health officials and Associated Press ====journalists==.== Health officials at the hospital said two of the dead were men sitting in the ====vehicle==,== and the ==blast== had ====fatally==== injured 61-year-old Samira Bardini ==as== she stood nearby.

Abed Bardini was in one of two ambulances dispatched to the scene. Back at the hospital, he unloaded the ====stretcher==== with practiced professionalism, ====squinting==== into the late afternoon sun ==as== he wheeled the body across the hospital ====courtyard==.==

Inside, medical staff pulled back the blanket to check for signs of life, and Bardini’s strength ======collapse==d==.==

Later, his tears exhausted, he sat in the ==morgue== beside Samira’s body with his head in his hands, comforted by his Red Crescent colleagues. They held a ====funeral==== prayer over her body in the ====parking lot==,== then Bardini personally helped carry the body into an ambulance for burial.

A spokesperson for the Israeli ====military==== did not immediately comment on the strike. Israel says it carries out precise strikes in Gaza targeting Palestinian ====militants==== and tries to avoid harming civilians. But the strikes often kill women and children.

Hamas-led ====militants==== killed some 1,200 people and ====abducted==== around 250 in the Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel that triggered the war. Israel’s ====retaliatory==== war in Gaza has killed more than 43,000 Palestinians, according to local health authorities, who do not say how many were ====combatants==== but say more than half were women and children. Gaza’s Health Ministry said Wednesday that 102 deaths were recorded over the past 24 hours.
