LIMA, Peru (AP) — China’s leader [Xi Jinping](https://apnews.com/hub/xi-jinping) met for the last time with U.S. President Joe Biden on Saturday but was already looking ahead to President-elect Donald Trump and his “America first” policies, saying Beijing “is ready to work with a new U.S. administration.”

During their talks on the ====sidelines==== of the annual [Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit](https://apnews.com/article/peru-apec-biden-xi-lima-china-fc2ac014b2f7314bfa1a53351b0bc3a7) in Peru, Xi cautioned that a stable China-U.S. relationship was critical not only to the two nations but to the “future and destiny of humanity.”

“Make the ==wise== choice,” he cautioned. “Keep exploring the right way for two major countries to get along well with each other.”

Without mentioning Trump’s name, Xi appeared to signal his concern that the incoming president’s ====protectionist==== ====rhetoric==== on the campaign trail could send the U.S.-China relationship into another ==valley.==

“China is ready to work with a new U.S. administration to maintain communication, expand cooperation and manage differences so as to ==strive== for a ==steady== transition of the China-U.S. relationship for the benefit of the two peoples,” Xi said through an ====interpreter==.==

Xi, who is ==firmly== ====entrenched==== ==atop== China’s political ====hierarchy==,== spoke ====forcefully==== in his brief remarks before reporters. Biden, who is ====winding==== down more than 50 years of public ser==vice,== talked in broader ====brushstrokes==== about where the relationship between the two countries has gone.

He reflected not just on the past four years but on the decades the two have known each other.

“We haven’t always agreed, but our conversations have always been ==candid== and always been ==frank.== We’ve never kidded one another,” Biden said. “These conversations prevent miscalculations, and they ensure the competition between our two countries will not ==veer== into conflict.”

Biden urged Xi to ====dissuade==== North Korea from [further deepening its support](https://apnews.com/article/north-korea-russia-ukraine-059d73e4c3492c19b555476b2fb45ca9) for Russia’s war on Ukraine. The leaders, with top ==aides== surrounding them, gathered around a long rectangle of tables in an expansive conference room at a Lima hotel.

They had much to discuss, including [China’s indirect support for Russia](https://apnews.com/article/china-russia-sanctions-united-states-ukraine-drones-49e4e56bb37ee46faf028f649df140b0), human rights issues, technology and Taiwan, the ====self-ruled==== ====democracy==== that Beijing claims as its own. On ====artificial==== intelligence, the two agreed on the need to maintain human control over the decision to use nuclear weapons and more broadly improve safety and international cooperation of the rapidly expanding technology.

There’s [much uncertainty](https://apnews.com/article/trump-china-tariffs-taiwan-foreign-policy-7351ce1069654f1c1aefb560b36dcc17) about what lies ahead in the U.S.-China relationship under Trump, who campaigned promising to ==levy== [60% tariffs](https://apnews.com/article/tariffs-trump-taxes-imports-inflation-consumers-prices-c2eef295a078a76ce2bb7fedb0c5e58c) on Chinese imports.

Already, many American companies, including Nike and eyewear retailer Warby Parker, have been ====diversifying==== their sourcing away from China. Shoe brand Steve Madden says it plans to [cut imports from China](https://apnews.com/article/steve-madden-china-tariffs-trump-9df8a62a4b7552b1702ac3649dcab5f1) by as much as 45% next year.

In a ====congratulatory==== message to Trump after his victory over ==Vice== President Kamala Harris, Xi called for the U.S. and China to manage their differences and get along in a new ==era.== In front of cameras Saturday, Xi spoke to Biden — but it was ====unmistakable==== that his message was directed at Trump.

“In a major ====flourishing==== ====sci-tech==== ====revolution==,== neither ====decoupling==== nor supply chain disruption is a solution,” Xi said. “Only ==mutual,== beneficial cooperation can lead to common development. ‘Small yard, high fence’ is not what a major country should ==pursue.==”

Biden administration officials have said they would advise the Trump team that managing the intense competition with Beijing will likely be the most significant foreign policy challenge they will face.

On Saturday, White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan said Biden had ====reinforced==== to Xi “that these next two months are a time of transition” and that the president would like to pass off the U.S.-China relationship “in stable terms” to the new administration.

Biden has viewed his relationship with Xi as among the most ====consequential==== on the international stage and put much effort into ====cultivating==== it. The two first got to know each other on travels across the U.S. and China when both were ==vice== presidents, interactions that both have said left a lasting impression. They last met a year ago on the APEC ====sidelines==== in Northern California.

“For over a decade, you and I have spent many hours together, both here and in China and in between,” Biden said. “We’ve spent a long time dealing with these issues.”

But the last four years have presented a ==steady== stream of difficult moments.

The FBI this week [offered new details of a federal investigation](https://apnews.com/article/china-fbi-hacking-flax-typhoon-trump-ed1c4c2cf6fc3b07834c799add215f44) into [Chinese government](https://apnews.com/hub/china) efforts to hack into U.S. telecommunications networks. The initial findings have ====revealed==== a “broad and significant” [cyberespionage campaign](https://apnews.com/hub/espionage) aimed at stealing information from Americans who work in government and politics.

Sullivan said Biden raised the matter with Xi during their talks and that the U.S. will have more to say about the investigation in the weeks ahead.

U.S. intelligence officials also have assessed China [has surged sales to Russia](https://apnews.com/article/united-states-china-russia-ukraine-war-265df843be030b7183c95b6f3afca8ec) of machine tools, microelectronics and other technology that Moscow is using to produce ====missiles==,== tanks, aircraft and other ====weaponry==== for use in [its war against Ukraine](https://apnews.com/hub/ukraine).

And tensions ==flared== last year after Biden ordered the shooting down of a Chinese ==spy== ====balloon==== that traversed the United States.

Biden wants Xi to [step up Chinese engagement](https://apnews.com/article/china-north-korea-russia-ukraine-united-states-0d28afb21d3afbdbb3cb9c29a945c3f5) to prevent an already dangerous moment with North Korea from further ====escalating==.==

Biden, along with South Korean President Yoon Seok Yul and Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba, on Friday [condemned North Korean leader Kim Jong Un’s decision](https://apnews.com/article/biden-south-korea-japan-north-korea-russia-24e1a85916b650c130c5b167cd3c8b79) to send thousands of troops to help Moscow ==repel== Ukrainian forces who have seized territory in Russia’s Kursk border region.

White House officials have expressed ====frustration==== with Beijing, which accounts for the vast majority of North Korea’s trade, for not doing more to ==rein== in Pyongyang.

The North Koreans also have provided Russia with ====artillery==== and other ====munitions==,== according to U.S. and South Korean intelligence officials. And the U.S., Japan and South Korea have expressed alarm over Pyongyang’s ==stepped-up== [==cadence of ballistic missile tests==](https://apnews.com/article/north-korea-missile-launch-united-states-4173ce128b8336b2cb315a3bf62c6980).

Kim ordered testing exercises in the lead-up to this month’s U.S. election and is claiming progress on efforts to build [capability to strike the U.S. mainland](https://apnews.com/article/north-korea-missile-launch-377c07eac46ad41bda0d4445df6f51d5).

Xi and Biden started their day at the leaders’ ====retreat==== at the APEC summit, taking part in a photo where they all ==wore== ====scarves==== made from vicuña ==wool,== a symbolic animal for Peru. It’s common practice that leaders at these gatherings are given a gift — usually traditional clothing of the host country — that they don for the photo.
