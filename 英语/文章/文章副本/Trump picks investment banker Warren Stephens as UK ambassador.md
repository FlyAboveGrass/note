> [Trump nominates banker Warren Stephens as UK ambassador](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c20e79nlpe6o)


President-elect Donald Trump has ====nominated==== businessman Warren Stephens to serve as America’s ====ambassador==== to the United Kingdom.

“Warren has always dreamed of serving the United States full time,” Trump said in a statement on Truth Social. “I am thrilled that he will now have that opportunity as the top ====diplomat==, representing the USA to one of America’s most ====cherished==== and beloved ==allies.==”

Stephens, who is CEO of private Arkansas-based investment bank Stephens Inc, donated millions to Trump’s re-election campaign this year.

If his ====nomination==== is successful, Stephens will help to maintain the so-called “special relationship” between the US and the UK.

The two countries maintain close ====military==, intelligence, and cultural ties.

Trump has ==vowed== to rework the US’ relationships abroad, vowing to implement an “America-first” ==ethos== to foreign policy.

The role of US ====ambassador==== to the UK is one of the most ====coveted==== ==diplomat==ic positions, and presidents have been known to ==bestow== the role to ====prominent==== backers.

During his first term in office, Trump appointed Woody Johnson, a top Republican donor and owner of the American football team the New York Jets, as UK ====ambassador==.

Barack Obama chose long-time Democratic Party ====fundraiser==== and lawyer Louis Susman as his first ====emissary==== to the UK - or the Court of St James.

Stephens did not always back Trump’s candidacies, however. In 2016, when Trump first ran for president, Stephens donated about $4m (£3.1m) to political groups that sought to stop Trump’s ==ascent,== the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette reported at the time.

The investment banker also donated over $2m to a political action committee that supported former UN ====Ambassador==== Nikki Haley as she unsuccessfully ran for president in 2024, the campaign finance watchdog OpenSecrets found.

When Trump ultimately ====triumphed==== in this year’s Republican presidential primary, however, Stephens threw his support behind him. Federal campaign finance data show he also donated to Republican groups and US Senate candidates this year.

In a statement, Stephens said he was honoured by the ====nomination==.

"I have expressed to President Trump that I would be extremely proud to serve our country and his administration, working to implement the President’s ==agenda== and further strengthen the long-standing alliance between the United States and the United Kingdom,” he said.

He and his wife also maintain a ====philanthropic==== organisation, the Harriet and Warren Stephens Family Foundation, which has donated to the Arkansas Museum of Fine Arts, the University of Mississippi, and the Episcopal Collegiate School in Little Rock.
