After [Luigi Mangione](https://apnews.com/article/unitedhealthcare-ceo-killing-charges-extradition-64ba21747f41c3a81f661900e797b6d7) made the difficult decision to ====undergo==== ==spinal== surgery last year for chronic back pain, he became a ====proponent==== of the procedure that changed his life for the better.

He repeatedly posted on Reddit about his recovery and offered words of encouragement for people with similar conditions, telling them to push back against doctors who suggested they had to live with pain.

But ====notably==== ==absent== from the posts are ====explicit==== concerns about ====corporate==== greed in the health insurance industry. Those appear to have surfaced only later: in a handwritten note found after Mangione was ====detained==== as a suspect in the killing of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson.

That short document references “parasites” in the health care system and laments the power and profits of health insurers, according to law enforcement officials. During his first public words since his arrest in Pennsylvania, Mangione ====emerged==== from a patrol car shouting about an “insult to the intelligence of the American people” while ==sheriff==’s ====deputies==== pushed him into a courthouse.

There’s no indication Mangione was ever ====insured==== by UnitedHealthcare, a senior New York City police official said in an [interview Thursday with NBC New York](https://www.nbcnewyork.com/manhattan/no-indication-luigi-mangione-ceo-killing-insured-unitedhealthcare/6064863/).

The killing has nonetheless prompted [widespread speculation](https://apnews.com/article/united-healthcare-ceo-luigi-mangione-josh-shapiro-3a8c64a0bc412e0eeb84bca0c99b6e67) about whether he had a [bad personal experience with the health care system.](https://apnews.com/article/unitedhealthcare-delay-deny-depose-insurance-online-criticism-2d9c9a1a2a551876e72a11a93fc7624c) But after his 2023 surgery, Mangione’s Reddit posts suggest he was ====overwhelmingly==== ====pleased==== with the outcome and finally relieved of chronic pain. He encouraged others not to be frightened by horror stories of surgeries gone bad. He also ====referenced==== a ====backpacking==== trip to Asia earlier this year.

The [26-year-old Ivy League graduate](https://apnews.com/article/unitedhealthcare-ceo-brian-thompson-shooting-luigi-mangione-10ee2f70cd843a27940a9cf1a06edf55) appears to have stopped posting on social media roughly six months ago, around the time he lost touch with loved ones.

Family and friends expressed shock at news of Mangione’s arrest, but little information has ====emerged==== about his recent mental and physical health.

Mangione’s Reddit posts reference a ==spinal== condition called ====spondylolisthesis==,== which occurs when a fracture causes a ====vertebra==== to slip out of alignment. It can result in severe pain if the bone puts pressure on ==spinal== nerves.

The condition, which can originate in childhood or from an injury, started negatively impacting Mangione’s life in recent years, according to his social media posts.

After earning his ==bachelor==’s and master’s degrees from the University of Pennsylvania, he worked at the Santa Monica-based car-buying website TrueCar until 2023 and lived in Hawaii for some time starting in January 2022. During a six-month stay at Surfbreak, a “co-living” space in Honolulu, Mangione’s back pain worsened in part because of a surfing incident.

Josiah Ryan, a spokesperson for the owner and founder of Surfbreak, R.J. Martin, said Mangione had expressed growing concerns about the pain. In addition to missing out on recreational activities and exercise, he was worried about how it could affect romantic relationships.

“That was definitely a theme in his time there,” Ryan said. “He wasn’t a big complainer. So it wasn’t like he was bringing it up constantly. But the people who knew him knew this was a significant part of his life.”

In July 2023, Mangione wrote in a Reddit post that he had decided to get surgery.

“I got caught in this loop for a year, all the while putting my life on hold in my 20’s and damaging my nerves while I ====waffled==== on the decision. I have surgery scheduled in two weeks and I keep wondering why I was so afraid of it,” he wrote.

According to his posts, the operation was a success.

An image posted to an X account linked to Mangione showed what appeared to be an X-ray of a metal ==rod== and multiple ==screws== inserted into his lower ==spine.==

“Surgery was painful for the first couple days, but I was shocked that by day 7 I was on literally zero pain meds,” Mangione posted on Reddit in August 2023. “Obviously will be ==awhile== until I get into ====rigorous==== activity, but it was way less of a big deal than I had ====anticipated==.==”

Medical experts say treating back pain is almost always a challenge.

“In the ==gross== majority of treatments, surgery is when everything else has failed to provide relief,” said Dr. Jason Pittman, co-director of the ==Spine== Center at Boston’s Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. He said doctors generally try ====conservative==== treatments like physical therapy, injections or medications before surgery.

Even people with health insurance can face thousands of dollars in bills from a surgery depending on their ====deductible==== and other ====factors==,== though it’s unclear whether Mangione experienced any of those issues.

Experiencing chronic back pain can also significantly impact mental health, said Dr. Padma Gulur, a pain specialist with Duke Health.

Luigi Mangione, the suspect in the UnitedHealthcare CEO’s killing, suffered from back trouble and brain ==fog.== A look at the new details that have ====emerged==.==

“If you have underlying mental health issues — anxiety, depression — your pain can be worse because you have way more suffering,” Gulur said. “But, the second aspect is pain can push you into anxiety and depression.”

Little is known about Mangione’s mental state in recent months, but it appears he was withdrawing from close relationships. Since-deleted posts on X show a friend repeatedly reaching out and getting no response.

His family reported him missing to San Francisco authorities in November, police said.

Earlier, while in college, Mangione posted on Reddit about experiencing severe brain ==fog== and restless sleep.

In a July 2018 post, he said his grades were suffering and he had considered dropping out of school. But ultimately, “staying in college has at least let me maintain some ====semblance==== of normality,” he wrote.

His last Reddit post is dated May 17, but other statements around that time suggest he wasn’t experiencing unexpected complications or renewed back pain. He appears to be advocating for the type of surgery he received months earlier.

He posted in early April about the gear he brought on a two-month ====backpacking==== trip through Asia that included some cross-country motorcycling, saying he had found “the perfect balance between minimalism and practicality.”

In late April, he advised another Reddit user with a back problem to “keep trying different surgeons” and, if necessary, convey an ====inability==== to keep working.

“We live in a ====capitalist==== society,” he wrote. “I’ve found that the medical industry responds to these key words far more urgently than you describing ====unbearable==== pain and how it’s impacting your quality of life.”
