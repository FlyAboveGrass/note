====Antibiotics==== are ==hailed== as medical ====saviours==.==

But they are increasingly facing a ==crafty== ==adversary==: bacteria that ==mutate== and adapt and ==outwit== the very drugs designed to defeat them and cure the infections they cause.

These antibiotic-resistant "superbugs" directly caused 1.14 million deaths worldwide in 2021, according to The Lancet, a medical journal. ====Antibiotics==== - which are considered to be the first line of defence against severe infections - did not work on most of these cases.

India is among the countries hardest hit by "==antimicrobial== ====resistance==". In 2019 alone, antibiotic-resistant infections caused around 300,000 deaths. They alone are responsible for the deaths of nearly [60,000 newborns](https://amr-review.org/sites/default/files/160518_Final%20paper_with%20cover.pdf) each year.

But some hope is on the horizon. A number of promising locally-developed new drugs show potential to ==combat== antibiotic-resistant ======pathogens==. They also offer a game-changing solution to preserve ====last-resort==== treatments.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a drug-resistant bacteria, is a major concern for doctors

Enmetazobactam, developed by Chennai-based Orchid ==Pharma,== is the first ====antimicrobial==== invented in India to be approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). This injectable drug treats severe conditions like ======urinary====== ==tract== infections (UTIs), ====pneumonia==== and bloodstream infections by targeting bacteria’s defence ====mechanisms==== rather than the bacteria itself.

Bacteria often produce ====enzymes==, like beta-==lactamase==, to destroy ====antibiotics==. Enmetazobactam binds tightly to those ====enzymes==, ====neutralising==== them and allowing the antibiotic to kill the bacteria effectively.

To put it simply, the drug ====immobilises==== the bacteria’s "weapon" without triggering ====resistance==== easily. This also preserves the effectiveness of other ====antibiotics==, including carbapenems, which are the reliable “last line of defence” drugs.

Trials across 19 countries - the drug has been approved by global regulators - with more than 1,000 patients have shown its effectiveness. “The drug has shown remarkable potency against these bacteria that have evolved over the years. It is administered via ====intravenous==== [IV] ====infusion==== in hospitals, specifically for critically ill patients, and is not available over the counter,” Dr Maneesh Paul, the lead co-inventor of the drug, told the BBC.

Mumbai-based Wockhardt is testing a new antibiotic, called Zaynich, for severe drug-resistant infections. Developed over 25 years, the drug is currently in Phase-3 trials and expected to launch next year.

Dr Habib Khorakiwala, founder chairman of Wockhardt, has [described](https://www.wockhardt.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/chairmans-agm-speech-2024.pdf) Zaynich as a "ground-breaking, one-of-its-kind new antibiotic designed to ==combat== all major superbugs". It was administered on ====compassionate==== grounds to 30 critically ill patients in India who were unresponsive to any other ====antibiotics==. Remarkably, all survived. "This would make India proud," Dr Khorakiwala said.

Mumbai-based Wockhardt is testing promising new ====antibiotics==== that will work on drug-resistant bacteria

Also in Phase-3 testing is Wockhardt's Nafithromycin, ====trademarked==== as MIQNAF, a three-day ==oral== treatment for community-acquired bacterial ====pneumonia==== with a 97% success rate. Existing treatments to the disease have ====resistance==== as high as 60%. Its trials are set to conclude next year and once it's approved, the company says it could be launched commercially by late next year.

A 30-member Bengaluru-based biopharma firm Bugworks Research has partnered with Geneva-based non-profit Global Antibiotic Research and Development Partnership, or GARDP, to develop a new class of ====antibiotics==== for treating serious drug-resistant infections. Currently in early Phase-1 trials, the drug is five-to-eight years from market ====readiness==.

"==Antibiotics== are becoming less effective, but big money is in drugs for cancer, diabetes and other conditions, not ====antibiotics==," Anand Anandkumar, CEO of Bugworks, told the BBC. **"**There's little ====innovation==== because ====antibiotics==== are kept as a ====last-resort==== option. Big ==pharma== isn't focusing on antibiotic ====resistance==. We've been funded by different organisations, but less than 10% of our funding comes from India."

But that needs to change. A 2023 drug ====resistance==== ====surveillance==== report by Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), which analysed nearly 100,000 bacterial cultures from 21 specialised care hospitals around India, highlighted worrying trends in antibiotic ====resistance==.

E.coli (Escherichia coli), commonly found in the ====intestines==== of humans and animals after consumption of ====contaminated==== food, was the most frequently ====isolated==== ====pathogen==.==

This was followed by Klebsiella ==pneumonia==e, which can cause ====pneumonia==== and also infect the blood, cuts in the skin and the lining of the brain to cause meningitis. Coming close was the rise of the multidrug-resistant ====pathogen==== called Acinetobacter baumannii, which attacks the lungs of patients on life support in critical care units.

The survey found antibiotic effectiveness against E.coli had consistently sharply declined while Klebsiella ==pneumonia==e showed an alarming rise in drug ====resistance==.== Doctors found that some of the main ====antibiotics==== were less than 15% effective in treating infections caused by these ======pathogen==s==.== Most worrying was the rising ====resistance==== to carbapenems, a critical ====last-resort==== antibiotic.

Doctors say antibiotic ====prescription==== practices in India urgently need reform

"It's like playing ====whack-a-mole==== with bacteria. They ==evolve== at an incredibly fast pace, and we’re always playing catch-up. You get rid of one, another pops up. We need more ====innovation==== and to learn from past mistakes," Dr Manica Balasegaram, executive director of GARDP, told the BBC.

Not surprisingly, GARDP is focussing on India. It’s collaborating with Hyderabad-based Aurigene Pharmaceutical Services to produce zoliflodacin, a novel ==oral== antibiotic for gonorrhea, a sexually ====transmitted==== disease which is showing increasing ====resistance==== to ====antibiotics==.== GARDP has also partnered with Japan's ==pharma== company Shionogi to distribute ====cefiderocol==== - a breakthrough FDA-approved antibiotic for tough infections like UTIs and hospital-acquired ====pneumonia==== - in 135 countries, with plans for production in India.

But this is only one part of the story. Doctors say drug ====prescription==== practices in India urgently need reform. The widespread use of broad-spectrum ====antibiotics==== - they target many bacteria types but can kill good bacteria, cause side-effects and increase antibiotic ====resistance==== - fuels drug ====resistance==== by encouraging the emergence of drug resistant bacterial ====mutants==.==

Instead, say doctors, narrow-spectrum ====antibiotics==== should be prioritised. But hospitals often lack antibiograms - microbiology-based antibiotic guidelines - forcing doctors to ====prescribe==== "broadly and blindly".

India's crowded hospitals are hotspots for infections

"I am definitely excited that we will have these new drugs. But what is also important is that we should create ====mechanisms==== that they should not be misused the way we have previously done with [what were once also] ====blockbuster==== drugs. Improper and irresponsible use will compromise the ====longevity==== of these new drugs," warns Dr Kamini Walia, a scientist at ICMR.

The rapid mutation of bacteria, which can ==evolve== in a matter of hours, underscores the urgency of a ====holistic==== approach. This includes reducing infections through better water, ====sanitation==== and ====hygiene==,== improving ====vaccine==== ==uptake,== strengthening hospital infection control policies, educating physicians and ====deterring==== self-medication by patients. “Combating ====antimicrobial==== ====resistance==== is a complex, ====multi-faceted==== challenge tied to healthcare equity and systemic ====accountability==,==” says Dr Walia.

The message is clear: without urgent action, we risk a future where even relatively minor infections could become untreatable.
